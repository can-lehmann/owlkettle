nbText: """# Wrapping GTK widgets
This is a small guide on how you can wrap and contribute widgets from GTK to Owlkettle!

## Best Practices
When wrapping GTK widgets, keep in mind the best practices and coding conventions of Owlkettle as defined by [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://can-lehmann.github.io/owlkettle/CONTRIBUTING.md).
As a piece of general advice, prefer to stick as close to the original GTK widget as possible.

## Find the GTK widget docs
First find the docs belonging to the GTK widget so you know what it can do and what you need to wrap.
Generally searches on the [GTK documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) or a web search with `GTK widget docs <widgetname>` should do it.

## Setup
Next let us create the type for the widget and an example application for it.

Go to `owlkettle/widgets.nim` and add your type as `renderable <GtkWidgetName> of BaseWidget: discard`.
If the GTK Documentation says that your widget inherits from another widget that is already wrapped (e.g. `Window`), then please inherit from that widget instead.
Then add an explicit export statement at the bottom of the file.

With the type available, we need an example application so we can see the widget in action.
Copy this example application to `examples/widgets` with the filename <widgetName>.nim` and adjust it to your needs:

## Wrap GTK functions
Now we can look over the GTK docs we found earlier and look for the GTK functions needed.

Add them to gtk.nim to the section for their class, marked by comments of `# GTK.<ClassName>`.
If no such section for a GTK widget exists, add a new one. 
You will need to wrap, at minimum, the constructor for the new widget.

Keep the following things in mind:
  - If a function parameter in the docs inherits from `GtkWidget`, then use `GtkWidget` for the type
  - Use the nim equivalent for any C-type in the docs: `cbool` for `bool`, `cfloat` for `float`, `cdouble` for `double` etc.
  - If the docs of a function mention that the caller needs to free the memory of the return value, then use a managed type for the return-type such as `OwnedGtkString` for cstrings (see e.g. `g_file_get_path`)

For examples of constructor functions, look for procs with the `_new` suffix in [GTK.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/gtk.nim).

## Add Initialization to the Widget
Next we need to tell Owlkettle create the GTK widget during the construction of the Owlkettle widget.
This is done as part of Owlkettle's `beforeBuild` hook.

Add a `beforeBuild` hook to the widget type in `widgets.nim`.
All it needs to do is call the constructor for your widget and assign the created `GtkWidget` to `state.internalWidget`.
If the constructor requires parameters, add fields with their values to your widget and access the values from the implicitly available `widget` variable and its `val/has<Fieldname>` fields. 

For examples, see the [beforeBuild docs](https://can-lehmann.github.io/owlkettle/book/internals/hooks/before_build_hook.html) or search for `beforeBuild:` in [widgets.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/widgets.nim).

## See your example in action!
Once you're at this step you should be able to compile your example and see your widget in action!
Run it with `nim r --path:. ./examples/path/to/your/example.nim` from the base dir of your Owlkettle repository clone.

Use your example to manually test your widget as you add features to it in the later section.


For a short example, look at Owlkettle's [counter-example](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/examples/counter.nim).


## Add fields to the Widget
The next step is adding fields to your widget.
Owlkettle fields usually map to the GTK widget's properties.

E.g. you may be able to show or hide values, change their positioning, enable or disable them etc. by updating certain fields at runtime after the widget was constructed.

Take a look at the properties of the GTK widget.
At minimum, try to wrap all properties exposed by your widget and possibly its direct parent (e.g. for `Gtk.Scale` everything from there as well as its parent `Gtk.Range`).
If the GTK Widget can contain child widgets, [create the appropriate adders](https://can-lehmann.github.io/owlkettle/book/internals/adders.html).

Follow and repeat the following steps to add a field:
- Create bindings for the GTK setters of the property
- Add a field for the property
- Add a `property` hook for the field that calls the GTK setter function.
- Run your example application to check whether the added field works.


## Add Signal Event Listeners
Now we can enable the Owlkettle widget to react to GTK signals!
Note that this section is irrelevant if the widget or its parent do not provide any signals.

#### 1) Add the proc signature of signal-handler procs under the widget fields. 
First we need to define the signal-handlers that will be executed when a signal gets fired. 
They act as intermediary between GTK and Owlkettle, translating the GTK signal into an Owlkettle event.
After the event was handled, the signal-handler triggers a rerender.

To define a signal-handler, look up the signature of the handler for the given signal in the GTK documentation.
A custom signal-handler needs to:
- Read back any state changes from GTK
- Call the event callback (and pass any arguments it might have)
- Call redraw to update the user interface after the event was handled
Use existing signal-handlers as a guide.

For examples of signatures for signal-handler procs, go to [widgets.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/widgets.nim) and look for proc signatures in between widget fields and hook definitions.

#### 2) Add a `connectEvents` hook to the widget type in `widgets.nim`
When the Owlkettle widget gets created, it needs to register its signal-handler procs with the GTK widget.
Only then can GTK trigger their execution when a signal occurs and have Owlkettle fire an Owlkettle event in response.

For this, add the `connectEvents` hook and in it, call the provided `connect` proc: `state.connect(state.<eventName>, "<signalName>", <eventCallback>)`
Where:
  - `<eventName>` is the name of the Owlkettle event
  - `<signalName>` is the name of the GTK signal
  - `<eventCallback>` is the signal-handler
  
If a signal does not require the state of the widget to be updated (e.g. `clicked`), you can use the default `eventCallback` proc for <eventCallback>.
If a signal does require the state of the widget to be updated (e.g. `select`), you will need to define your own <eventCallback> proc.

For general examples of `connectEvents` hooks, search for `connectEvents:` in [widgets.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/widgets.nim).

For examples that use the default eventCallback, search for `, eventCallback` in [widgets.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/widgets.nim).

For examples that use custom eventCallbacks, enable regex search in your IDE and search for `connectEvents:\n.*?proc` in [widgets.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/widgets.nim).

#### 3) Add a disconnectEvents hook to the widget type in `widgets.nim`
Finally you need to create a `disconnectEvents` hook. 
It should call the `disconnect` procedure for each event callback of the widget like this:
`state.internalWidget.disconnect(state.<eventName>)`.

## Add and update documentation
Once you are satisfied with your widget, it's time to add a bit more documentation.

#### 1) Add documentation and examples
Add doc comments to fields and event callbacks to explain what they do.

Further you can add examples using Owlkettle's `example` macro to demonstrate usage of the widget.
These will get automatically added to `widget.md`.

For examples that use the `example` macro, use the existing widgets in [widgets.nim](https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/owlkettle/widgets.nim) as a guide.


#### 2) Update widgets.md and examples/README.md
Once that is done, run `nimble genDocs` to add your new widgets, doc comments, and examples to widgets.md, the main documentation file for widgets. 
Once finished, commit the updated widgets.md.

Next take a screenshot of your example application and add it to `docs/assets/examples`.
Note that the Screenshot should be:
  - Of the application in light theme
  - Against a transparent background (in e.g. Gnome: Screenshot of only the window itself)
  - Taken at 200% resolution (settable in e.g. Gnome under Gnome Settings -> Displays)
  
Lastly, add an entry for your new widget to the widgets table of `examples/README.md` like so (Remember to replace the `<Widgetname>`, `<WidgetExample>`, `<WidgetExampleImage>` and `<50% Screenshot width>` placeholders):
```html
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/can-lehmann/owlkettle/blob/main/examples/widgets/<WidgetExample>.nim"><WidgetName></a></td>
    <td><img alt="<WidgetName>" src="../docs/assets/examples/<WidgetExampleImage>.png" width="<50% Screenshot width>px"></td>
  </tr>
```
Note that the table **is sorted alphabetically**.

Finally, you can submit your widget to Owlkettle by opening a pull request!
