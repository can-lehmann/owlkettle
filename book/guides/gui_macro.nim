# `gui` Macro

In owlkettle, graphical user interfaces are described using the `gui` macro.
It provides a domain-specific language for specifying widget trees.

You can set fields on each widget in the widget tree.
Fields may either be set in the argument list of a widget...

## Adders

Adders specify how a widget is added to its parent.
For example, the `HeaderBar.addLeft` adder places the given widget on the left side of the header bar, while the `addRight` adder places it on the right.
Adders are specified using pragma expressions (e.g. `{.add, expand: false.}`).
Which adders are available at any place in the widget tree depends on the parent widget.
If no adder is specified, the `add` adder is used by default.

Each adder may receive a series of properties.
For example, you can use the `expand` property of the `Box.add` adder to specify whether the given child widget should expand to fill up remaining space in the box.

## `insert` Statement

The `gui` macro returns a `Widget` object.
The `insert` statement inserts a `Widget` object previously returned by another `gui` macro into the current widget tree.
It is commonly used to implement container widgets.
