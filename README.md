# Owlkettle
*Freshly brewed user interfaces.*

Owlkettle is a declarative user interface framework based on GTK.

```nim
import owlkettle

viewable App:
  counter: int

method view(app: AppState): Widget =
  result = gui:
    Window:
      title = "Counter"
      default_size = (200, 60)
      border_width = 12
      
      Box(orient = OrientX, spacing = 6):
        Label(text = $app.counter)
        Button:
          text = "+"
          style = {ButtonSuggested}
          proc clicked() =
            app.counter += 1

brew(gui(App()))
```

The code above will result in the following application:
