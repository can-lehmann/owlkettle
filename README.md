# Owlkettle
*Freshly brewed user interfaces.*

Owlkettle is a declarative user interface framework based on GTK.
It is written in Nim.

Here is an example for a simple counter app. When you click on the "+" Button, the counter increments.

```nim
import owlkettle

viewable App:
  counter: int

method view(app: AppState): Widget =
  result = gui:
    Window:
      title = "Counter"
      defaultSize = (200, 60)

      Box(orient = OrientX, margin = 12, spacing = 6):
        Label(text = $app.counter)
        Button {.expand: false.}:
          text = "+"
          style = [ButtonSuggested]
          proc clicked() =
            app.counter += 1

brew(gui(App()))
```

The code above will result in the following application:

Owlkettle also supports building libadwaita apps.
To enable libadwaita, import `owlkettle/adw` and change the last line to `adw.brew(gui(App()))`.
